This script acts as a virtual assistant that automatically visits a travel website about Australia to find and save information for you. It starts by opening the website and clicking to close any pop-up messages. Then, it searches for "Queensland" in the search bar and selects the relevant option from the suggestions. Once it finds the section about Queensland, it navigates to the page, locates a specific description about the area, and extracts the text. The script then creates a file on your computer, saves the extracted information in it, and lets you know the task is complete along with the file's location. This entire process happens without any manual effort, making it an efficient way to gather and store information.
